                    <h1>Profile</h1><hr>
                    <p>My name is Lili Bourgeois and I am currently a student at Prime Digital Academy studying Full Stack Engineering. I recently decided to make a career change from an education background to begin the adventure of learning web development.</p>
                    <p>For the last 6 years I have worked in various positions in education. I began my career with a focus on special education working mainly in self-contained classrooms. As I began to form my philosophy on education I made a shift to work in inclusive settings that focused on differentiated learning and individualized objectives.</p>
                    <p> In 2016 I received a Masters in Education with a concentration of Secondary Science Education from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I began my teaching career in Springfield, MA where I was employeed as a full-time life science teacher. I strived in my classroom to incorporate various technologies as a way to provide students with a multitude of various learning modalities.</p>
                    <p>As a teacher in a district that serves peoples of many cultures, languages, and backgrounds, I began to see a pattern in the technologies that were available. Many of the applications that I hoped to use were limited in their capacity to individualize learning, meaning that students with varying background knowledges would be left to work on the same assignment with little differentiation. I found myself struggling; as a scientist at heart I understand the importance of technology, yet I was left with applications that did not work in the context of my situation. </p>
                    <p> I decided then that I wanted to one day create an application designed to provide students with individualized learning paths, tailored towards their interests, so that each student would be learning the same content but through the student's lens rather than the teachers. This application would also take into account such metrics as background-knowledge, and reading and math levels, to ensure that content was being delivered in a way that set high standards but with a focus on student understanding. </p>
                    <p>Though my level of knowledge to complete this goal is limited, I know that my enrollment in Prime Digital Academy is the first step.</p>
